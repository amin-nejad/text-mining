# Text Mining Challenge

Given a list of webpage URLs in `sources.txt`, the challenge is to scrape the websites and perform Named Entity Recognition

Install the requirements into a python 3.7 virtual environment using `conda env create -f environment.yml`

Also, requires connection to a neo4j database. Follow instructions here: https://neo4j.com/developer/get-started/

Then follow the Jupyter Notebook in a sequential manner

Most of the functionality has also been created into a streamlit application. Run `streamlit run app.py`
